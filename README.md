## A smart Lamp

### The problem
It so happens that I forget to switch off the study lamp after use most of the time.
Hence I want to automate it switching on and off based on my proximity to it.


### How did I arrive at this problem?
I face this situation on a daily basis. I wish I wouldn't have to walk up to my desk to switch the lamp on /off.
### The Five Why ?'s 
Why is it a problem ? Human forgetfulness.
Why do we forget ? Laziness
Why are we Lazy ? It is a pain to switch on/off the lights everytime I leave the desk
Why is it difficult to switch on/off ? Poor placement of the switches.We forgo less important things in favor of more important ones.
Why do we forgo less important things? Human nature.

### The solution
Ive decided to a sensor to the lamp inorder to detect human presence near it.Once it is detected , the light is turned on.Once it detects that there is no human presence around ,it switches itself off.

Below is a stop motion Video on the solution proposed.
